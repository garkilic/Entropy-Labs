			<h2><u>Our Thesis</u></h2>
			<p>
				We believe that the point of building new things is to solve problems,
				no matter how small. Most companies look to solve billion dollar
				problems that can scale efficiently. While this can create large world
				change, it leaves smaller problems without people to solve them. Our
				sole focus is solving problems, creating managable/scalable solutions,
				and then moving onto another product. The idea is that this can be
				repeated indefinitley, only time will tell.
			</p>
			<p>
				We decided to start dedicating our time to solving problems in niche
				markets that are often overlooked or misunderstood. We are able to do
				this by taking on a lean methdology approach that is powered by the
				latest Artificial Intelligence tools.
			</p>

			<h2><u>How We Build</u></h2>
			<p>
				We begin by choosing a market and conducting research into the largest
				problems in the market. Then we focus on solutions to problems that fit
				within our self-imposed limitations of technical and financial
				viability. Following this research, we work with users extensively to
				test MVPs as quickly as possible, with the hope to launch a new product
				within three months and create a manageable process within six months.
			</p>
			<p>
				The specific tools, criteria, and processes are specific to our
				organization and are our special sauce. We follow the basic frameworks
				of Lean Startup, Week Long Sprints as set out by Google Ventures, and
				the Business Model Canvas (as well as our own methodologies).
				Furthermore, we utilize AI tools to supplement large parts of this
				process to turn months long testing into weeks. We believe our process
				is unique and can provide a range of solutions that have been
				undervalued in the current tech market.
