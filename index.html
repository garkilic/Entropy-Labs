			<h1><u>The systems we have built are broken</u></h1>
			<p>We need to work on breaking and building new systems. We have lost all the punk rock attitude that used to drive new ideas. We are too complacent. Too worried about being outspoken. People like Donald Trump and the Republican party think it's okay to bully, intimidate, and take people's rights aways.</p>
		
			<p>From now on, I am dedicating my time to building and creating things to make the world a better place. This can span things like software and projects focused on dismantling the ideas and systems that allow hate to spread, or it can be projects that bring people together.</p>
			<p>Building thesis: Anything that gets people out of echo chambers and offline is good. We all have the capacity to be good, but the technology in the world is making us angrier and more divided than ever before.</p>
<p>We all need to be better.</p>
<p>Love, Griffin</p>
