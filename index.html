			<h1><u>The systems we have built are broken</u></h1>
			<p>We need to work on breaking and building new systems. We have lost all the punk rock attitude that used to drive new ideas. We are too complacent. Too worried about being outspoken. People like Donald Trump and the Republican party think it's okay to bully and intimidate.</p>
			<p> I don't. </p>
			<p>From now on, I am dedicating my time to building and creating things to make the world a better place. This can span things like software and projects focused on dismantling the ideas and systems that allow hate to spread.</p>
<p>We all need to be better.</p>
<p>Love, Griffin</p>
